# SilverSniperSpotifySongDownloader-ServerEdition

The SSSSD was made to download songs and that, the setup.py may have problems sometimes, but it overall works


# It supports
- Single Tracks
- Playlists
- Albums
- Lan use, or even hosting it on the internet

Local 127.0.0.0
Lan 0.0.0.0 (Your machine's local ip for others to access it, also works over tailscale. wireguard and whatherver else)

Yes, has web gui.
Next updates to fix the rest.
Accuracy 90% # (MAYBE EVEN 80%).


Download FFMPEG from https://github.com/Tyrrrz/FFmpegBin/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file 
And place the ffmpeg.exe, ffplay.exe and ffprobe.exe in the folder ast (idk i just gave it that name)


I made it as a self hosting alternative for these service, maybe next time i make it as a docker container. (After i get to know how lmao)
